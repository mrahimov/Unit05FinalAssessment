We didn't have any trouble with getting the data, parsing it, storing it, or retrieving it. What we did have some issues with
is the job service and notification. The job service runs at different times on different Android APIs (API 22 vs 25 for example).
The notifications are also hard to test. Please run Android API 25 when loading the app since the job service and notification
start and appear quickest on that API.
